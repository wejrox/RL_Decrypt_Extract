# Rocket League decryptor and extractor
This project aims to provide a means for the easy decryption and extraction of encrypted Rocket League UPK files.  

## Usage
Build the executable and place it in the folder which contains the UPK files that you wish to process.  

## Testing
Rigorous testing has not been completed on this application, so it is not suitable for large batches of files.
If you would like to add testing, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Credit
The application was created by me (wejrox), but it basically just runs the decryptor, then uModel with `nogui` options.
